SPDIF to TOSLink Adapter Hat for Quartz64
=========================================

This is a small 3 component PCB that allows you to plug a TOSLink cable into
your PINE64 Quartz64 single-board computer.

You'll need the following components for assembly:

- 2x3 long 2.54mm spacing female pin row headers, e.g. SSQ-103-03-G-D
- a 0.1ÂµF ceramic capacitor for decoupling
- Everlight PLT133/T10W TOSLink transmitter

The last component is supposedly "obsolete" according to DigiKey, but they have
a lot of stock and other distributors seem somewhat confused about the
obsolescence of various products by this manufacturer. I wouldn't worry about
it too much.
